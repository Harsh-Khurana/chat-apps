# chat-app
So this repo currenlty just has a basic chat app that i made just to learn socket.io by developing but soon this repo will also have a fully functional chat-app which i'll add later (maybe after a few months) 

But for the basic chat app you can go through the code i have commented it out very nicely to explain what happens where and how
