## Chat Apps
Currently this repo has two apps -
* basic-chat-app - Built with socket.io, a basic chat app with decent UI that utilizes websockets for making conversations.
* secretMessage - Basic JS app that uses base64 encoding for hiding messages that are attached to link hash, making messages readable to anyone with the link.

> Note: The link to github page attached is for secretMessage app. To try basic-chat-app download the files and try locally.

> Hopefully I'll add more advanced chat apps soon
